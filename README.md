_Note: I took the git course as a stand alone course and not as part of a nano degree.  Therefore, I did not complete the bike share project.  I attempted to write python code based on the function descriptions but my code may not match the expected functionality base on the original course content._

### Project Title
Bike Share Data Statistics

### Description
This project allows a user to obtain various statistics related to a bikeshare dataset.  When running the program, the user will be asked to enter a city, month and day of the week.  The program will then read in the appropriate dataset, filter by month and day of week and return various statistics on the filtered dataset.  It also keeps track of how long it took to calculate each set of statistics.

### Files used
**Python**

bikeshare_2.py

**CSV**

The program is also expecting a set of csv files (not included) for chicago, new york city and washington with the bikeshare data to analyze.

Files should contain the following columns:

- Start Time
- End Time
- Trip Duration
- Start Station
- End Station
- User Type
- Gender
- Birth Year

### Credits
This template was forked from a udacity project and the project was inspired by a project from a former udacity class

### Usage
This program can be run with the following command:

`python bikeshare_2.py`

The program will then prompt you on what further information to enter.
